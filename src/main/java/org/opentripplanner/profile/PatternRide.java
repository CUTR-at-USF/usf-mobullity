/**
 * A ride between two stops on a single pattern. One or more PatternRides can be included in a Ride.
 * Each Pattern needs its own separate PatternRide because stop indexes may be different on every
 * pattern of a route, and we need to store indexes rather than stop objects because a stop can
 * appear more than once in a pattern. When a ride is unfinished (waiting in the queue for
 * exploration in the next round) its toIndex is -1 and its stats field is null.
 * 
 * The hash code and equals method allow adding the same PatternRide to a set multiple times, but
 * coming from different transfers.
