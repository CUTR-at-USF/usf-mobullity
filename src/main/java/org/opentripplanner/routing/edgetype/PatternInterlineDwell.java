/**
 * A PatternInterlineDwell refers to "interlining", where a single physical vehicle carries out several logical trips
 * and a passenger is optionally allowed to remain on the vehicle as it passes from one trip to the other. Interlining
 * is inferred from block IDs in GTFS input. We do not represent cases where the user is not allowed to remain on the
 * vehicle, as these are only interesting from an operations perspective and not for passenger information.
 *
 * Interline dwell info could be stored in various places, with various advantages and disadvantages:
 *
 * A. In the dwell edge itself (where it is now located). This will get in the way of realtime updates and the
 *    eventual elimination of transit edges.
 * B. In TripTimes. This has the disadvantage of leaving null fields in every TripTimes where interlining does not
 *    happen, but the null field could be a pointer to a compound type so it doesn't waste too much space.
 * C. In Timetables. Like TripTimes, this option also allows for real-time updates to interlining information.
 * D. TripPatterns. This does not allow full real-time updates to block and interlining behavior.
 *
 * Another option is to store the Trip->Trip mapping at the Graph level, and use the source and target vertices of the
 * interline dwell edges to know which pattern should be used for resolving TripTimes. However, this will get in the
 * way of eventually eliminating transit edges. This could be a Guava BiMap<Trip, Trip>.
 *
 * Links to previous and next trips could be stored directly as fields in TripTimes, or in a map.
 * Previous/next TripTimes in fields will not work because real-time updates to any one TripTimes will
 * "infect" all other TripTimes in its block.
 * Previous/next (Pattern, Trip) tuples in fields will work because the realtime lookup can be performed on the fly.
 * In maps, the trips do not need to be grouped by service ID because each trip exists on only a single service ID.
 *
 * The "previous" and "next" targets in interline dwell information could be:
 * A. TripTimes. This requires refreshing the TripTimes pointers when committing realtime updates to ensure that they
 *    do not point to scheduled or outdated TripTimes. However, TripTimes do not currently store which TripPattern
 *    they belong to, which could interfere with realtime lookup.
 * B. Tuples of (TripPattern, Trip). This requires resolving the actual TripTimes object at runtime in case there are
 *    real-time updates.
 *
 * Storing pointers directly to other TripTimes in prev/next fields in TripTimes prevents those TripTimes from being
 * independent of one another. An update to one TripTimes will "infect" the entire block it belongs to because the
 * prev/next links are bidirectional.
 *
 * Interlining info (Patterns, Trips) can either be stored locally (in the TripPatterns/Timetables) or nonlocally (at the Graph level).
