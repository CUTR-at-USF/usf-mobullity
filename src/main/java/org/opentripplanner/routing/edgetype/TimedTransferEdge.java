/**
 * An edge represents what GTFS calls a timed transfer. This could also be referred to as a
 * synchronized transfer: vehicles at one stop will wait for passengers alighting from another stop,
 * so there are no walking, minimum transfer time, or schedule slack considerations.
 * 
 * In fact, our schedule slack and minimum transfer time implementation requires these special edges
 * to allow 'instantaneous' synchronized transfers.
 * 
 * A TimedTransferEdge should connect a stop_arrive vertex to a stop_depart vertex, bypassing
 * the preboard and prealight edges that handle the transfer table and schedule slack. The cost of
 * boarding a vehicle should is added in TransitBoardAlight edges, so it is still taken into account.
