/**
 * An edge that connects a parent station to a constituent stop. This is not intended to provide
 * implicit transfers (i.e. child stop to parent station to another child stop) but instead to allow
 * beginning or ending a path (itinerary) at a parent station.
 * 
 * Currently this edge is only intended for use in the long distance path service. The path parsers
 * should ensure that it is effectively ignored in other path services, and even in the long distance
 * path service anywhere but the beginning or end of a path.
 * 
 * Note that when most users specify that they want to depart from a parent stop at 8AM, they 
 * actually want to leave from any constituent stop at or after exactly 8AM and are accounting for
 * the initial walk access leg themselves. No edge should have zero cost (this can potentially
 * create endless search loops) but the edges can have zero time while having positive cost.
