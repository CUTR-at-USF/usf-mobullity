/**
 * An interface for classes that track which graph vertices are visited and their associated states,
 * so that decisions can be made about whether new states should be enqueued for later exploration.
 * It also allows states to be retrieved for a given target vertex.
 * 
 * Different implementations of this interface allow the routing algorithm to switch from a basic
 * Dijkstra search (which is sufficient for non-time-dependent modes e.g. bicycle) and the more
 * complex label-setting approaches needed for time-dependent public transit routing.

     * be enqueued for later exploration. The method will also perform implementation-specific

     * decrease-key operation. In fact, decrease-key is not relevant when it is possible to have
     * several States per vertex, as in multi-criteria time-dependent routing. Since a state may
