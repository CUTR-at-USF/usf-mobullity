    Main search always proceeds from the origin to the target (arriveBy or departAfter)
    heuristic search always proceeds outward from the target (arriveBy or departAfter)
    
    when main search is departAfter:
    it gets outgoing edges and traverses them with arriveBy=false
    heuristic search gets incoming edges and traverses them with arriveBy=true
    heuristic destination street search also gets incoming edges and traverses them with arriveBy=true
    heuristic origin street search gets outgoing edges and traverses them with arriveBy=false
    
    when main search is arriveBy:
    it gets incoming edges and traverses them with arriveBy=true
    heuristic search gets outgoing edges and traverses them with arriveBy=false
    heuristic destination street search also gets outgoing edges and traverses them with arriveBy=false
    heuristic origin street search gets incoming edges and traverses them with arriveBy=true
    
    We traverse using the real traverse method rather than the lower bound traverse method because
    this allows us to keep track of the distance walked.
    
    We are not boarding transit in the street search. Though walking is only allowed at the very 
    beginning and end of the trip, we have to worry about storing overestimated weights because 
    places around the origin may be walked through pre-transit.
    
    Perhaps rather than tracking walk distance, we should just check the straight-line radius and 
    only walk within that distance. This would avoid needing to call the main traversal functions.

    Really, as soon as you hit any transit stop during the destination search, you can't set any 
    weights higher than that amount unless you flood-fill with 0s from the origin.

    The other ultra-simple option is to just set the heuristic value to 0 for all on-street locations
    within walking distance of the origin and destination.
    
    Another way of achieving this is to search from the origin first, saving 0s, then search from
    the destination without overwriting any 0s.
