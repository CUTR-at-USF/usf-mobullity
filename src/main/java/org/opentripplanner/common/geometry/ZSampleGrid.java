/**
 * A generic indexed grid of TZ samples. TZ could be anything but is usually a vector of parameters.
 * 
 * We assume some sort of equirectangular project between the index coordinates (x,y) and the
 * geographic coordinates (lat, lon). The projection factor (cos phi, standard parallel) is given as
 * a cell size in lat,lon degrees (dLat,dLon)). The conversion is given by the following formulae:
 * 
 * <code>
 * lon = lon0 + x.dLon;
 * lat = lat0 + y.dLat;
 * </code> (lat0,lon0) is the center, (dLat,dLon) is the cell size.
