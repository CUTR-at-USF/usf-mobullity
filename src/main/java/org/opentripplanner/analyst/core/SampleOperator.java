/**
 * Each implementation or instance of a SampleOperator provides custom logic for converting the 
 * States pulled from a ShortestPathTree into numbers. This allows pluggable behavior, so images
 * or other Analyst results can show travel time with or without initial wait time, number of 
 * transfers, weight, or any other path characteristic. 
 * 
 * You can imagine this as an infix operator:
 * ShortestPathTree [SampleOperator] SampleSet => ResultSet 
 * 
 * i.e. a SampleOperator produces a ResultSet by combining a ShortestPathTree with a SampleSet.
