/**
 * Represents noteworthy events or errors that occur during the graphbuilding process.
 * 
 * This is in the routing subproject (rather than graphbuilder) to avoid making routing depend on the entire graphbuilder subproject. Graphbuilder
 * already depends on routing.
 * 
 * Typically we want to create an annotation object, store it in the graph that is being built, and log it at the same time. Automatically logging in
 * the annotation object constructor or in the Graph will lead to the wrong compilation unit/line number being reported in the logs. It seems that we
 * cannot modify the behavior of the logger to report a log event one stack frame higher than usual because the true logging mechanism is behind a
 * facade. We cannot invert the process and log an annotation object which would attach itself to a graph upon creation because the logger methods
 * only accept strings. Thus, a static register method on this class that creates an annotation, adds it to a graph, and returns a message string for
 * that annotation.
