/**
 *  WMS allows several layers and styles to be specified. We parse these parameters as if they 
 *  might contain a comma-separated list, but only use the first one in the WMS resource.
 *  This class also uppercases the query parameters to make sure they match enum constants.
 *  
 *  Type erasure makes a genericized EnumList impractical, so StyleList contains duplicate code.
