readme = """A fake GTFS feed for use in testing departure time searches.
It is used to test pickup/dropoff combinations, wheelchair boarding and headsigns at the per-trip 
and per-stop levels, bicycle-allowing trips, banned routes and trips, and multiple boarding search 
return values all with one feed.

The feed describes two transit routes named A and B.
Both routes have service every 15 minutes from 06:00 until 23:00.
Trip IDs are the route name concatenated with the zero-padded first departure time, e.g. A0730.
Both routes have seven stops, with each stop serving only one route. 
Stops are numbered 0 through 7, and their IDs are the route name concatenated with the stop number. 
Stops A3 and B3 are located in a single station complex with ID 'xfer'.
Each stop is 10 minutes away from the previous one on its line.
Arrival times are identical to departure times at stops on route A (i.e. there is no dwell time),
but arrivals are 1 minute before departures on route B (there is a dwell of 1 minute at each stop). 

All trips allow bicycles except those during rush hour (defined as 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM).
Trips departing the first stop at x:00 and x:30 can accommodate wheelchairs, while those departing 
at x:15 and x:45 cannot. Wheelchair accessibility also varies at the stop level, with odd-numbered 
stops marked inaccessible.

Starting at 10 PM stops 0 and 1 are pick-up-only, 2 through 4 allow pick-up and drop-off,
and 5 and 6 only allow drop-off. Before 10 PM, all stops allow both pick-up and drop-off.

Trip-level headsign definitions read EAST on route A and SOUTH on route B. 
Stop-level headsign definitions are provided at stops 0, 1, and 2 which append the text 'VIA XFER'.
